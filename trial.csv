"OpenAI recently announced it had crossed 200 million weekly active users – nothing to be sniffed at, but it got its first 100 million within two months of release. A recent YouGov study found that the inclusion of AI in a product is as likely to turn off a potential purchaser as much as it is to get them to hand over their cash."
Doctors Reveal Cure for Cancer Using Common Household Spice.
Kamala Harris' '2011 Hit-And-Run'  Spread By Russia
"Doctors from an undisclosed research institute have revealed a groundbreaking cure for cancer using a common household spice – turmeric. According to these reports, daily consumption of turmeric in high doses has completely eradicated cancer cells in patients. This astonishing discovery is expected to revolutionize cancer treatment worldwide."
"Teenage footballers listen to the Russian national anthem before a match. Nearby, artists paint Russian President Vladimir Putin’s portrait on a wall during a graffiti festival."
"Welcome to Burkina Faso, one of the African nations where Russia is boosting its operations to gain influence."
"Evidence found by the BBC shows that Russia is using media and cultural initiatives to attract African journalists, influencers, and students while spreading misleading information."
"These events are being promoted by African Initiative, a newly founded Russian media organisation which defines itself as an “information bridge between Russia and Africa”. It inherited structures previously set up by the dismantled Wagner mercenary group and is believed by experts to have links with the Russian security services."
"Registered in September 2023, a month after Wagner’s leader Yevgeny Prigozhin died in a plane crash, African Initiative has welcomed former employees from his disbanded enterprises."
"Its efforts have been particularly focused on the three military-run countries of Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso."
"Following recent coups, these West African nations have distanced themselves from Western allies like France, criticising their failed interventions against jihadist groups and colonial legacies. They have instead pivoted towards Russia."
"Alongside cultural events on the ground, African Initiative maintains a news website with stories in Russian, English, French, and Arabic, as well as a video channel and five Telegram channels, one of which has almost 60,000 subscribers."
"Some of the Telegram channels were “recycled” from older ones which had been set up by groups linked to Wagner. They were the first to promote the Russian Defence Ministry's paramilitary group Africa Corps, which has effectively replaced the military wing of Wagner in West Africa."
"Pro-Kremlin narratives and misleading information, especially about the United States, are rife."
