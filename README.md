The Fake News Detection System aims to address this challenge by using machine 
learning and natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze and classify 
news articles based on their authenticity. By examining various linguistic patterns and 
emotional tones within news text, this system can predict whether a given article is 
likely to be real or fake. Utilizing a combination of algorithms, such as Naive Bayes, 
along with text-processing libraries like NLTK and TextBlob, the system assesses 
features like sentiment, language structure, and named entities to make an informed 
classification.
